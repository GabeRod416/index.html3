				The New York Police Department can no longer hide its officer disciplinary records following the state’s repeal of a statute called 50-a. The New York Civilian Complaint Review Board, CCRB, which investigates civilian complaints about NYPD officer misconduct, has provided records to ProPublica following their request. As described on ProPublica, the database contains “more than 12,000 civilian complaints filed against New York City police officers.” The database is a record of police officers who are still on the force who have had substantiated misconduct allegations spanning from 1985-2020. 

				The report containing nearly 35,000 allegations, revealed that race and ethnicity play a role in how officers conduct themselves on the job. The data shows that over half (51%) of the allegations are reported by Black individuals.

				While white civilians account for filing 8% of the reported allegations, white NYPD officers account for well over half (54%) of the alleged misconduct. The Chart below may help visualize this disparity.

				A quarter (25%) of all the complaints were ultimately substantiated by the CCRB. Across all of the ethnicities provided, the rate in which the complaints get substantiated fall within 23% and 35% with reports from black civilians falling on the lower end of that spectrum. Of the allegations, nearly 500 of them specifically mention the role race and ethnicity played in the officers misconduct. The chart below will demonstrate of a majority of those allegation ended up unsubstanciated. 
			</p>
			<p> Pro Publica notes that proof of officer misconduct is not limited to those that are substantiated. They write, they "include cases where an investigator found that what a civilian alleged did happen but the conduct was allowed by the NYPD’s rules. The Police Department’s guidelines often give officers substantial discretion, particularly around use of force. Those cases are classified as “exonerated.”” </p>
